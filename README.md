# Pwnagotchi-Wifi-Handshake-Device

I built a Pwnagotchi using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a WaveShare V3 e-paper display, and I 3D-printed a custom case to complete the setup. Since then, Iâ€™ve been collecting Wi-Fi handshakes and successfully cracking a few.

My next goal is to develop a custom plugin for GPS Wardriving, enabling me to log Wi-Fi access points along with their geographic coordinates and visualize them on a map. Excited to see where this project goes next!
